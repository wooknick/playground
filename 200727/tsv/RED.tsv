Rage Against the Machine	https://youtu.be/F9S-JVKw0mE	F9S-JVKw0mE	Zach's anger is a gift to humanity. 	
			Rage makes me wanna flip a cop car	
			RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE IS MODERN DAY THERAPY TO MY EARS.	
			I tried telling my mom what they were singing at the end but she smashed me with a wooden spoon.	
			I actually feel sorry for Metallica who had to play after them.	
			Some of the most important music ever written. These guys give every ounce of energy they can give.	
			"There's never been a band like RATM, they're one of a kind. One of the greatest of all time."	
			We need a little Rage right now. This is for the people of the Sun.	
			"de la Rocha is one of the greatest rappers of all time, but because he does it in a rock format, you never his name mentioned."	
			Governments invented covid19 to stop ratm tours	
Korn	https://youtu.be/jR88BgYMlbQ	jR88BgYMlbQ	Are you READY!?!	
			Crowd turns into Liquid	
			"I wonder how many people went with their friends, went crowd surfing and then could never find the people they came with after that"	
			and this is how the 90s said goodbye	
			David Sylveria was a sick drummer.	
			"A crowd with no phones, that's something you'll never see again :("	
			munkys frog leap dance move	
			"not gonna lie, I'll always miss the 80s and 90s"	
			Falling Away From Me was really sick.	
			They're one of the literal best bands ever.	
	https://youtu.be/NpSKLOjC0ts	NpSKLOjC0ts	"damn this music reminds me of not doing homework, playing n64, drinking orange soda, coming inside from rollerblading"	
			late 90's nu metal era is forever the shit.	
			Iphone free crowd. Those were the days. Proper mosh pit too!	
			THAT MOUSTACHE.	
			Dave Silveria is so underrated.	
			THE days of Adidas vs Puma.	
			"PA/Sound was amazing!  The guitars, amps and pedals, everything was perfect.  That bit with Ice Cube was amazing."	
			Can't explain the feeling of listening to korn songs <3	
			Munky getting really into it	
			"Silveira's chops so intense, them sudden blasts.."	
	https://youtu.be/toBpygISzeM	toBpygISzeM	"Why do people record when there are professional recordings only a few days after, they ruin the shows"	
			I think Brixton Academy is one of my favourite concerts the sound is so much better cause it is indoors and small and the drums and guitars sound way better there than most concerts.	
			The energy it must take for JD to belt out these vocals for an entire show....fukn impressive!	
			"This is sad, Get rid of them phones and have a good time!"	
			I still love KoRn!	
			I love that I can name every song from every concert haha	
			My favourite band till the day I die.	
			dead bodies everywhere!!!	
			my dream watching KORN concert :-(	
			Dave Mustaine xD	
Queen	https://youtu.be/SbWLWNXsVxA	SbWLWNXsVxA	"This cleared my acne, cured my depression, and gave me good grades"	
			All songs of Queen are great	
			He truly was in a league of his own.  His live performances where just out of this world.  Nobody will ever come close to this mans ability	
			"There’s a love affair going on between Freddie and his audience, both ways."	
			I’ve been told I’m obsessed with Queen and Freddie. Uh yeah !!!!	
			"I couldn’t stop looking at Deaky, he’s just so mesmerising"	
			Freddie Mercury is a total performer ever in the history of music	
			Nobody talks about Freddie's good shape. Did he workout? what a great body!	
			Oh my god. They were and are amazing. Freddie was beyond incredible.  I’m in awe.	
			THE BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEST	
Hives	https://youtu.be/e2f0Ff2cfQY	e2f0Ff2cfQY	such a underrated band	
			"Damn, that drummer gets one hell of a cardio workout..."	
			"This is a perfect example of how every musician should act, BE ACE AND HAVE A BLOODY GOOD TIME"	
			"Damn, these guys are amazing live. "	
			Gentlemen doing punk	
			"music's missing danger, but these guys are doing a good job roughing it up"	
			That bass is fuzzrocious	
			"Something is wrong with his microphone... at first I thought it is still turned off, but maybe it is too quiet because the others sound much louder... weird o.O"	
			That was a great performance!	
			clockwork orange	
	https://youtu.be/4d_xk7sSIbU	4d_xk7sSIbU	"Maybe one of the most underrated frontmen and live acts since the 80s, swear down"	
			"The Hives are when The Stooges, Pixies, The B 52's, The Clash and DEVO all have an overly mischievous musical baby they will have to eventually put on Ritalin. Too much fun!"	
			"Good lord, what a HOT CROWD!  So many concerts nowadays, people just stand silent.  These gents are what live music is all about"	
			I love the insane style of Nicholaus Arson.	
			"Sometimes i'm really proud of being a swede. Best live band ever, Fagersta finest."	
			Good performance	
			The Hives in their prime!	
			still the best live band in the world!	
			THIS IS ROCK AND ROLL THIS IS THE HIVES	
			ohh boy	
Papa Roach	https://youtu.be/4w_OVYeea6c	4w_OVYeea6c	Respect  to Papa Roach. So many years playing and they still show so much energy!	
			"This man to this day still sings his heart out, so proud to be a fan."	
			The crowd is too calm at the beggining. And Jakob awake them ... nice job	
			I'm really pleased with this one. Hair was on point	
			Shaddix is a monster	
			This is one of the best Papa Roach's perfomances I've seen in  while! Also Anthony is doing an amazing job.	
			"how the hell does he sounds so good for so long, this guy is a rare gem"	
			"Jacoby is the best front man of a generation, always on point."

Linkin Park	https://youtu.be/7Mxg4VkkRRI	7Mxg4VkkRRI	I WENT WITH MY MOM! THANKS MOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	
			"Yup, Linkin Park still hits harder than Covid."	
			This is the best concert of their entire career.	
			"Whenever Chester screams, the crowd just go Crazy . What a power ."	
			So goddamn perfect it sounds like a studio recording	
			This was his prime. The power and the raspy voice at the same time.	
			How does chester sing like that for a whole concert? crazy	
			Chester one of those people who sound better live	
			Cant believe how good Chesters voice is live. Crazy.	
			One of the few bands that I will always think sound better live	
	https://youtu.be/VEljwjZen-A	VEljwjZen-A	There's no doubt this was one of Chesters best vocal performances. The stars aligned for him that night. True art here.	
			Greatest band of all time.Wish i could have seen them in concert with chester live.	
			My favourite band ever	
			This concert is chester's legacy	
			So beautiful sound	
			This is one of the best performances i've ever seen	
			Unbelievable. I have a background in classical voice and I'm a professional pianist.  His voice endurance is arguably the greatest of all time.	
			Watching these LP live shows makes me cry	
			Chesters voice was on point in this concert	
			MY GOD THIS IS GOOD---WISH I WAS THERE!	
AC/DC	https://youtu.be/lfSWQtCpEFk	lfSWQtCpEFk	“We don’t speak spanish very well but we speak rock n’ roll very good”	
			it’s one of my favourite live concerts ever! Brilliant stuff!	
			This crowd is FUKIN Insane!	
			THE BIGGEST CONCERT IN HISTORY TO TAKE PLACE AT A SECOND DIVISION CLUB STADIUM	
			The greatest Rock and Roll band EVER And what a concert	
			"""And God Said: Let There Be Rock!"""	
			River Plate is the ultimate audience for any rock band.	
			"And this, kids, is what real music means. Listen and learn."	
			Ac dc live at circus krone full.	
			This is exectley what Human beeing is about. Love it	
	https://youtu.be/epSe9V5ngeo	epSe9V5ngeo	bon scott ... best hard rock vocalist of all time... in my opinion	
			Bon Scotts jeans had to be surgically removed after the show.	
			True legends of rock	
			"my mom was always blasting acdc when I was little, thanks mom!"	
			Angus Young jumping all around on stage with his guitar yet keeping perfect control...always impresses	
			One of my first concerts.	
			Angus has some of the best vibrato I've ever heard.	
			Goddam Bon Scott was the real deal!	
			Bon Scott probably made groupies pregnant just by looking at them.	
			Damn Bon could sing like a beast live.	
Slipknot	https://youtu.be/QO3j9niG1Og	QO3j9niG1Og	Why does Corey’s mask make him look like a scary Ed Sheeran in this?	
			the only harmless thing in this concert is the giraffe	
			Corey’s voice is a lot better now than on the gray chapter era	
			AAAAAAAARRRRGGGGGGHHHHHH	
			Corey’s mask is what I look like when my allergies struck	
			Coreys mask looks like it has melted into his face	
			"Slipknot are like wine The more it ages, the more is good"	
			"You can tell how proud Corey is of his screams, he’s practically grinning the whole concert."	
			"Corey don't need autotune, autotune needs him."	
			The VOCALS are out of this WORLD!	
Metallica	https://youtu.be/zFJ4H0t7dWs	zFJ4H0t7dWs	"""Bleeding Me"" is such a beautiful song. And quite underrated too."	
			Who’s hoping for Kirk or James to do the intro this time?	
			they need to play bleeding me again. absolutely one of their BEST songs	
			Hetfield looking great here. Goatee James is underrated.	
			Metallica has insane luck with bassists	
			We need more bleeding me in Setlists	
			"Metallica is my therapy.  So  happy they exist, the earth would be a lesser place without them."	
			Creeping Death will forever be the best opener	
			The best band of the world. My friends forever ...	
			Devils Dance was definitely the surprise of this show	
	https://youtu.be/mJje9Xpp5GE	mJje9Xpp5GE	One of Metallica’s greatest accomplishments is  how they’ve managed to appeal to the same age group decade after decade while also retaining their aging fanbases. What a timeless band!!!	
			This was an absolutely kick ass show.	
			First gig I went to after kicking cancer's ass where I had energy for the whole set.	
			It’s so cool seeing the raindrops fly everywhere when Lars plays his drums!	
			That little solo in St. Anger was more unexpected than the Spanish inquisition	
			"The more pressure there is on Metallica, the better they play."	
			I still can’t get over how badass master of puppets was	
			"THAT EXTENDED VERSION OF ""MEMORY"" IS SUPER COOL !!!"	
			Props to Trujjillo for not dying his grey.	
			When playing 'One' and trenchfoot is an actual possibility	
	https://youtu.be/pjGYBktU71I	pjGYBktU71I	"The era when James went full trailer trash, Kirk looked like Michael Jackson, and Jason was just a head banging neck."	
			"I call this haircut on James, “The Kentucky Gentleman”"	
			"couple of good rare ones on the setlist, can't believe they played Enter Sandman"	
			Is it just me or does Newsted make everything better.	
			Jason Newsted was just perfect match for the band	
			50% of the metal energy in concert is due to Jason.	
			It would be nice if James and Kirk would crawl out of the hole they're hiding in and introduce one of these shows!	
			"The God that failed , proshot in 1994 , finally"	
			This was peak James hairstyle. So badass	
			Jason Newsted Forever	
Nine Inch Nails	https://youtu.be/LBC3NXnN8y4	LBC3NXnN8y4	Trent Reznor is the proof you don't need tattoos or piercings to be cool.	
			Thank you Trent.	
			That drummer is absolutely killing it.	
			"Trents looks 40.  Mick Jagger looks 1,000."	
			"The bass is so good especially with a nice set or headphones, they were on their shit this night"	
			absolutely love how the world keeps changing but his stage still looks like a map from Quake.	
			That bass player just went to play bass. He never moved.	
			How about that drummer?	
			Who the Hell is this amazing drummer? Crazy energy	
			Back up singer is Lisa Fischer... 	
Green Day	https://youtu.be/dO-Y_fMuc4c	dO-Y_fMuc4c	Billie is the only middle aged man in the world that could still pass as a teenager	
			Green Day are always so damn amazing live! 	
			Billie Unlocks Double Jumping	
			I admire everyone today who still loves new and old green day	
			Billie is the only middle aged man that vendors asks for ID when buying alcohol...	
			Who ever mixed this you are a god	
			Billie forgot his eyeliner	
			Looks epic!	
			Revolution Road :/	
			"Come on billie, where's When i come around?!"	
Liam Gallagher	https://youtu.be/37BDUBe6Tfg	37BDUBe6Tfg	All the Oasis tunes sound better when Bonehead is on the guitar.	
			Bonehead: The only guy in his 50s who can pull off wearing an adidas tracksuit.	
			Ive just realised bonehead was what I liked about Oasis's sound	
			Liam seems to feel more confident with Bonehead on stage. He should play permanently. We have 2/3 of Oasis there.	
			Has there ever been a cooler man to play the tambourine	
			Nobody is gonna say something about Sad Song? Greatest live version ever	
			Looks like Bonehead has given Liam's band a lesson or two...	
			Liam doesn't need Noel But Liam needs Bonehead !!!!	
			Can’t have enough Bonehead’s comments. He’s fkin LEGEND	
			Noel needs Liam so much more than Liam needs Noel.	
	https://youtu.be/EnzVduS-vyE	EnzVduS-vyE	biblical

			Once is one hell of a song	
Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds	https://youtu.be/WyYWRrqLOSA	WyYWRrqLOSA	"Noel just seems to get better and better as a singer, songwriter and guitarist. Such a legend."	
			Man who built the moon is a tune	
			"Liam is an entertainer, Noel is an artist"	
			´Alone on the rope´ should be on an album. Genius	
			Awesome I cant believe he played alone on the rope	
			I love how Gem plays the guitar!!	
			Alone On The Rope is such an incredible song.	
			This man is GOD.	
			Fort Knox is the perfect opening tune for a live performance!	
			"Really respect Noel as an artist, love him!"	
	https://youtu.be/BbEEcP79IDI	BbEEcP79IDI	NGHFB are amazing! 	
			Pretty cool that he uses the Adidas J-200 for the Oasis numbers	
			Yeah baby yeah!	
	https://youtu.be/GnnfXPJxnCo	GnnfXPJxnCo	Only Noel can open a show with a B side. Brilliant....	
			"If Oasis gets back together, they're going to make one of the best albums ever. Both Noel and Liam are on fire."	
			Never understood why people use their phones to record a gig which is being recorded with TV cameras. 	
			"This audio is stunning. Well done. Also, this performance is the reason why Oasis won't reform. Noel is on fire at the moment."	
			"Noel hasn't lost it. The voice isn't any different from the recorded tunes, if not better."	
			This is arguably one of Noel's best sets. And it also pretty much says oasis are done. He doesn't need them. 	
			"This sounds absolutely incredible. Unreal Audio, Noel never disappoints like."	
			"And Liam said Noel was the ""weird"" one.  Maybe Liam is an alien."	
			"Everybody's On The Run, The Dying Of The Light and If I Had A Gun gave me goose bumps..."	
			I can't think of anyone else who still writes songs like this.	
Foo Fighters	https://youtu.be/jcwBsntqjmY	jcwBsntqjmY	The fact they got Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones is the coolest thing ever	
			One of the best shows all time.	
			"A concert without smartphones, that must be crazy."	
			"""Dude, where are you going?"""	
			When Dave sings he looks like he’s riding a horse	
			The best show I've ever seen.	
			"Dave is my new god, after Frusciante, but who knows... OMG love this guy sooo much. Btw drummer is amazing too. Nope, Dave IS the best!"	
			Time to fight the foo	
			Times like these makes me wanna cry	
			whenever i saw Pat playing...i see happiness	
	https://youtu.be/A8z6rbmx7Mg	A8z6rbmx7Mg	Short haired Dave scares me	
			"The mix is absolutely insane, might be the heaviest live recording of theirs I've ever heard"	
			The foos never disappoint.	
			This show is incredible	
			They should play In Your Honor and DOA more often!!!	
			Taylor with short hair Looks like a member of the bee gees	
			It's times like these you learn to live again...	
			One of the best groups ever	
			Still My favorite all time band.

Red Hot Chili Peppers	https://youtu.be/PNd7cRl6Bfg	PNd7cRl6Bfg	This is the very first show of their Californication tour

			John frusciante feeling	
			Got scared when I saw flea up close sigh	
Guns N' Roses	https://youtu.be/UTulnklNm2Q	UTulnklNm2Q	I can’t believe SLASH is 54 years old.	
			Axl sounds more like mickey.	
			"If Axl had stuck with his Brownstone voice on Slither , it would have been epic!"	
			The Best Band in the worl !!	
			"Oh, the old good times when we could rock outside..."	
			I’m impressed that Axl did this song.  Slither I mean.	
			Axl would sound so much better if he just went down an octave.	
			When your bassist sounds better than the lead singer.	
			They should do these every Monday like Metallica.	
			Axl is awesome but slash carried the show i havent see him so energetic for a long time	
Sex Pistols	https://youtu.be/QBVDSz5Qd6g	QBVDSz5Qd6g	This sounds so bad and so damn good at tha same time. Legends	
			"Johnny Rotten is an incredible front man, sarcastic, cynical and with a very original voice, he is the joker on the stage"	
			I can't complain. Sid's bass playing skills are wayyy better than mine lmao	
			drummer deserves more credit than he got...	
			"i don't care what the general consensus is, I love this show."	
			johnny looks like he wishes he was in pink floyd.	
			John Lydon. One of the legendary Voices.	
			It's a miracle they got through this one hour show still standing up.	
			"For a guy who can’t play bass, „not even a bit“ Sid‘s playing is pretty solid."	
			Pretty vacant has got to be one of the best songs ever written.	
Lou Reed	https://youtu.be/yOoXjYppyMM	yOoXjYppyMM	Lou Reed had really amazing posture.	
			"We need more volume to Mr. Robert Quine, please"	
			Robert Quine on Lead Guitar!!!	
			Lou Read is one of the most underrated artists ever.	
			Makes my day. R&R sure is fun!	
			He's actually happy	
			"""...her life was saved by rock n roll"""	
			I can die peacefully having seen this dude (and band)  live	
			Man his voice sounds just fine. Usually at this point you'd notice some weakness.	
			Incredible.	
Grateful Dead	https://youtu.be/VnCvS2A7REo	VnCvS2A7REo	There is literally NOTHING better than a happy Jerry Garcia.	
			"Stay gold, Brent."	
			May the wings of Angels surround and protect you like the softest warmest blanket you have ever felt.	
			Imagine that! Bobby with Bobbie pins in his hair	
			"Turn off your mind, relax and float down stream..."	
			This is an excellent show....best “eyes” ever...& “he’s gone” on point!	
			This concert changed my life.	
			My goodness the boys were hot tonight. 	
			With a doubt! Nothing like a Jerry smile to make everything perfect!

			Whoever mixed the audio is a God those drums sound amazing!!!!	
			"This is what a concert is about, the band and crowd having a good time"	
			These guys were always a very different breed than the average pop-punk Mtv fodder bands of the early millennium.	
			"These guys are like wine, the older they gets the better they are!"	
			Now this is a great crowd: no phones and enjoying the moment.	
			The sound quality of this recording is incredible	
			That new song sounds even better live!	
	https://youtu.be/6F7qretnMAs	6F7qretnMAs	Epic drumstick fail	
			First three records are classy and flawless.	
			oh god that fat lip intro was spot on	
			nostalgia	
			I wish the bass was louder	
			"That random Slayer cover cracked me up, I believe Brownsound is a huge Thrash fan, I got his solo CD with his brother very good shit!"	
			someone likes slayer	
			This is cool	
			Aha wrong lyrics during rhythms that's cool

			This is the closest i will ever be to an mcr concert...	
			WHEN GERARD CHICKEN DANCED AROUND THE STAGE WHEN RAY WAS DOING HIS SOLO DURING TEENAGERS	
			Forever thinking about how Frank stayed onstage to watch Gerard sing the last song	
			I can’t comprehend how some people don’t like mcr. They are perfect.

			This is gotta be Gerard's best look	
Paul McCartney	https://youtu.be/1QGxFpSb6Sc	1QGxFpSb6Sc	He’s nearly 80 and he can still perform Helter Skelter. One statue does not do Paul McCartney justice.

			"God, how i'm fallin love too much with this music"	
			"man, that performance of ""the sound"" is absolutely mental."	
Police	https://youtu.be/3RWbh9KKkdI	3RWbh9KKkdI	I'm convinced stewart Copeland thinks his drums owe him money.	
			God will people just start playing instruments again for the love of god.	
			Why do we spend billions on particle accelerators when science should just study Stewart Copeland's  drumsticks LOL	
			anyone who tries to say that Copeland isn't one of the greatest drummers ever to walk on this planet needs their head looking at	
			Copeland in his prime was like TNT with drum sticks attached	
			"Stewart and his extreme attack , Andy's layed back chords and Stings Vocals and Bass are all absolutely Brilliant ."	
			the only concert that the band played entirely in their pajamas.	
			"What a band, what a DRUMMER....Stewart Copeland = god with a drumkit"	
			Nice to see no smartphones in the audience! :D	
			Sting solo career was good....... but with The police he is a master with the masters stewart and Andy...

Radiohead	https://youtu.be/C9_IhE5Xk0k	C9_IhE5Xk0k	i love how radiohead is releasing all this stuff it's so cool	
			King of Limbs is the definition of underrated...	
			i will force my children to listen to this	
			This is a good show because Thom has a ponytail.	
			they play in their own league... the most important band of the last 25 years...	
			Radiohead is an ancient treasure a moment of silence to the people that haven't heard them.	
			The end of Pyramid song is breath taking!	
			Thom dancing is so cool	
			Why does Jonny's guitar sounds so low at most songs?	
			Toms voice is totally on it through this whole thing	
	https://youtu.be/RjQZd8p-eBM	RjQZd8p-eBM	Back when Thom looked like a KPop star instead of homeless old man	
			Johnny Greenwood back when he was looking older.	
			6 years later this band released Kid A	
			It feels so weird that the audience isn't singing along to Fake Plastic Trees	
			"The ""My Iron Lung"" here is literally the recording used on the album. Fantastic stuff."	
			"There's something really special about ""Blow Out"""	
			They had such a different energy back in early 90's	
			Blow Out is really an excellent set closer.	
			Always weird seeing Phil with a wig	
			This is the most still i have ever seen Colin during a show	
	https://youtu.be/MuqDMOr_aLk	MuqDMOr_aLk	one of the best radiohead shows ever

Alanis Morissette	https://youtu.be/Y1RP0hXWgX0	Y1RP0hXWgX0	she makes it difficult for the snipers	
			She s Walked at least 20km	
			The bassist is the most 1999 looking man I have ever seen	
			Alanis was the Janis Joplin of this Woodstock '99 edition	
			Her voice is stunning. Just like it sounds on the albums.	
			Holy shit Alanis is good live. This set is off the charts good.	
			Alanis Morissette is a rock and roll goddess. Little pill was the soundtrack of the 90's and her and her band killed it at woodstock 99	
			This woman's voice is incredible! She's special.	
			She is authentic.	
			Great Performance... Awful crowd.

			THIS SETLIST IS GLORIOUS!	
			"The drummer is soooo on point, perfect performance!"	
			Armistice is on a different level	
			"so freaking amazing, this band is absolutely incredible and so underrated, and the drummer is a legend for sure!."

			"Keep your eye's open people, she's going down in music history."	
			Annie Clark is my queen.	
			She's so talented...one of the master of distortion guitar...	
			"Fantastic, now she's in her Bowie stage! Somebody introduce her to Nine Inch Nails"	
			The guitar solo at the end of rattlesnake is freaking awesome!	
			The effect on the snare at the beginning reminds me of an AT-AT shooting!	
			One of her best performances.	
			I love this so much. Annie is such a genius. 	
Courtney Barnett	https://youtu.be/xV_zbJ8SflU	xV_zbJ8SflU	Neil Young was right. Rock and Roll can never die. What a refreshing sound! 	
			Go Courtney!	
			She really is a true modern rock star.

			"So happy she added the keys to her live shows for the new record, makes the songs sound much fuller."

			"If you don't think Dan is adorable, you're wrong"	
			How can he sing and go up and down stairs at the same time. I can barely breath and go up the stairs.	
			How does his voice  not shake when he jump?	
			The security guy was so pissed when Dan climbed over  the pole during flaws	
			Dan's dorky dancing gives me life	
			his dance moves reminds me of Lorde's dance moves 	
			Bastille is the best band in the freaking world okay

Eric Clapton	https://youtu.be/fqz2AhQsRWE	fqz2AhQsRWE	Old slow hand Eric can still play a pretty mean guitar.

			Does anybody recognise what a good drummer Henri Spinetti is?	
			Love the music though!	
			"subtle and masterful, like old wine."

Chicago	https://youtu.be/_oAoSZ2y1cw	_oAoSZ2y1cw	Is anyone as obsessed with this concert as I am? It's led me to believe that Chicago is one of the top bands of all time.	
			Terry Kath was one of the best guitarists of all time.	
			"No pyro, no smoke machines, no big fancy light show...just a super talented band kicking ass for 90 minutes."	
			"Terry Kath - sang like Ray Charles, played like Hendrix ."	
			this is the greatest performance Ive ever seen in my life. How do such young people write such amaizing music.	
			"After watching this, I think Jimi Hendrix was right about Terry Kath!"	
			"This was Terry's band, what a guitarist!!!"

Placebo	https://youtu.be/NF5vr0owif8	NF5vr0owif8	"I just realized, nobody is holding up a phone, for a change."	
			One of the most underrated singer of all time! He sounds exactly like the studio version	
			Brian Molko looks kind of like Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction after the drug overdose here.	
			They should really try and play some songs from their first two records. They're legendary.	
			He looks like the king from Shrek with that hairdo	
			Placebo are really incredible and sincere...Brian's manner of singing is unique.	
			"This is awesome, Placebo are like a fine wine"	
			That chick with flower headband	
			"love placebe!great music and lyrics,much better than that comercial muse!"

Aerosmith	https://youtu.be/Gerf9gHEJoY	Gerf9gHEJoY	"Joe Perry , the coolest guy in rock history."

			Steven Tyler is without a doubt the greatest frontman in rock history.	
			Hands in the air without cell phones... You gotta love it!	
			"Everybody talks about Joe Perry, but can we please take a moment to note how Tom Hamilton is one of the coolest bassists ever?"	
			This is what a PROFESSIONAL rock band looks like!!!!!   	
			These Boy's were on top of their game at this show!	
			the best band of all time!!!! they have it all!!!	
	https://youtu.be/HSBOCnpLSV8	HSBOCnpLSV8	Tyler and Perry coked to the gills.	
			Gotta be one of the ugliest stage designs I have ever seen.	
			I was so high I thought it sounded great	
			Yikes.

			AC/DC smashed this event	
			Nice hearing Reefer Headed Woman...kind of rare!  Great tune.

			A fantastic performance by a great band at the peak of their powers.	
Ramones	https://youtu.be/Sp3zaeOyL7Q	Sp3zaeOyL7Q	And every kid in that crowd went home and started a band.....	
			This is absolutely one of the best recorded live concerts ever.	
			"Ramones didn't have a style, they were the style"	
			"how tf does joey breathe throughout without a break, what a king omg"	
			"Johnny is way underrated, even among Ramones fans. Arguably the best rhythm guitarist of all time."	
			This is what it feels like to go through a blender.	
			"Mind blowing, these guys didn't give a shit and built their own universe, epic."	
			Best live album of all times from any artists known to mankind!!!!!!!	
			This is a treasure.	
			One of the most powerful live performances  ever...	
Duran Duran	https://youtu.be/T4dKTblXrF4	T4dKTblXrF4	Most bands have a lead guitarist ... Duran Duran had a lead Bassist!	
			This is GOLDEN	
			John Taylor on top of his game! Dig that bassline...	
			"right out of the gate, Duran Duran's bassist is phenomenal...I never realized! Wow!"	
			They single handedly kept the white pants industry alive!	
			Outstanding! The Taylor's are all full throttle.	
			That bass is legit	
			I've always loved the bass on New Religion; absolutely funky and fabulous!	
			John Taylor and that bass.	
			This band has a lot of future potential.	
Fall Out Boy	https://youtu.be/-3LfOi2EfHE	-3LfOi2EfHE	this audience is why MCR wrote a song about teenagers
