			There's nothing like AIR.	
			"Music is a language in what it speaks to us, we ""understand"" something even if we don't know what. Thanks Air to give us these beautiful tones ;)"	
			Sounding that good is supernatural. There are exceptional sound guys working behind the band.	
			Absolut fantastic! The soul of old and new synths in perfect combination.	
			"This is magic, it's magic...music is the only language all people do understand. La Femme d'Argent is wonderful"	
			"what a great and potent version of ""how does it make you feel?"""

			If anyone can work those old vintage analogue's it's these boys. Great stuff guys.	
			I'd forgotten just how much I love Air.....what a class act they are!	
			Amazing!!	
			The opening of Cherry Blossom Girl just made me almost cry!! The lights!!	
			whoever did the lighting and the building it was perfect. the inside resembles a magnetic field. the reciprocating hyperbaloid

			One white boy in the back say he know how to two-step

			"She's the happiest singer on the stage ever, i love her positive vibe"	
			"She is born to be a performer. No back up dancers nor dance steps needed, just unbreakable connection with audience! ❤ you Anne Marie!"	
			She's a fan of her own. And that's a beautiful sight.	
			"She's pure talent, she slays either live or in recording."	
			Flawless She is so talented!!! Love her and her voice	
			Anne Marie is one of the few artists who can really put a show on. Like literally

			This is one of the most genuine concert i've ever watched! She's a gem!	
Ed Sheeran	https://youtu.be/223eI1x6PsQ	223eI1x6PsQ	"Talented beyond words, who doesn't he touch A great artist "	
			He's rocking the crowd with just his voice and his solo guitar.. He is truly a legend legend Singer.....	
			I love how ed sheeran only uses his looper instead of having a band with him. Hes just truly amazing and such a humble performer.	
			Finally someone who sounds just as good live as recorded	
			"Can't get enough of Ed,he's so talented. He reminds me of my son whose a musician too."	
			Just love Ed Sheeran Love all his music so talented

			He’s perfect like this! Doing everything with just a guitar. This incredible!	
			I love Ed Sheeran!!	
			"This performance is so smooth. I can't believe this is all live, nothing is pre recorded, he and himself as a one man band."	
			Bloodstream is so underrated	
			this guy is a one-man band all he need is his guitar and his loop pad	
			I listen to him every day! I love so much!❤❤	
			Someone proposed during the song <Perfect>	
			"Who else is lovin that older woman in the front, bobbin her head to the beat? Awesome!"	
	https://youtu.be/lR3vIjAZDnM	lR3vIjAZDnM	"Does anyone else not find it crazy that this whole concert is him, his guitar, and a loop pedal?"	
			That shows that he is one of the greatest musicians of our time.	
			ED Sheeran is precious and needs to be protected at all costs	
			"Ed is my daughter's hero, she wants to be just like him when she grows up. I see why."	
			i watched the whole video and guess what? i didnt waste a single second of life	
			HOLY JESUS ED IS AWESOMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!	
			"He's a one man band, and he is a genius for sure."

			"Almost 2 hours,  singing and playing by himself.  Absolutely legend.  "	
Tracy Chapman	https://youtu.be/kUXahDmsVdU	kUXahDmsVdU	She is my angel baby. I wish i could hug her for 10 mins straight.	
			This is one of those songs that seems like has existed from all eternity	
			Such a voice comes once in a century. So unique and touchy.	
			First heard this talented lady in concert opening for Bob Dylan about 30 years ago. I was blown away. Still am. Timeless.	
			"Thank you, Tracy, for sharing your artistic gifts. Your voice brings me comfort and smiles."	
			The best acoustic solo performance in history of popular music.	
			Tracy is the best	
			So pure and clean music.  A  guitar and her voice is all that was needed to make great music.	
			I love Tracy with my whole life!! Her songs have been a source of inspiration to me..	
			Very Real . Thank you Tracy .	
Simon & Garfunkel	https://youtu.be/Bxryb3xN-Lo	Bxryb3xN-Lo	So sad that there was no connection to each other on the concert. They made beautiful songs.

			ART VOICE is so Cool as ICE..	
			"These song has only four guitar key...Dm, C, Bb and  F"	
			"Thank you, Simon. Thank you, Garfunkel. Its An everlasting Joy."

			Best performance in recent years!	
Lumineers	https://youtu.be/353lHGbvu8o	353lHGbvu8o	Don't understand how Woody Harrelson has time to play the drums for these guys in between his acting gigs.	
			If The Lumineers dont perform on my funeral im not going.	
			"""It's better to feel pain than nothing at all"""	
			there are a few things in life that a human being just should not do. disliking the lumineers is one of those things.	
			Ive never heard a more genuine sounding band.  These guys need to go on tour with the head and the heart.	
			"this isn't music. This is far beyond that. Anyone can make songs but not many can make you ""feel it"". I feel it."	
			Neyla deserves more attention than she actually receives.	
			"the drummer always looks like he's having the time of his life. Great band altogether, i hope they will be around for many years."

			I wanted to listen to their music without  crying. Impossible.

			Incredible. The audio is amazing. The Engineers need a massive credit	
			Gary seems to get a genuine kick out of hearing the audience sing his music. The huge smile on his face is adorable.

			"The performance of “Heal Me” is stunning, epic!!!"

			He is being he's true self and he's glowing	
			"Live Sam. People just need to stop with their negativity, no one cares. Spread positivity!"

			They literally turned an Award Show into a CONCERT.	
			Sorry Grammys but this was better than your whole show	
			This performance proved that BTS didn't forget from where they started	
			"I can't say anything except... ""I feel so proud! I'm about to cry."""	
			This shows how the Grammys can't afford a stage for BTS. It's like trying to put a chandelier inside a phone booth xD	
			So Grammys were scared of the quality that BTS serves	
			That water dance is one of Jungkook's MOST ICONIC dances ever	
			Ok. But This whole performance will forever be ICONIC.

			Instrumental songs that express more than any lyrics

Chvrches	https://youtu.be/1L9iUhiOXbE	1L9iUhiOXbE	Finally!	
			This is the first time I've heard chvrches and I'm impressed.	
			That was one of the sickest intros I've ever seen....	
			"Shes gotten better at performing, she used to be real shy and quiet while singing."	
			Why is Tether so underrated	
			They should play Strong Hand in their playlist.

			I rarely like every song from an album.

			His band is incredible and they really give that energy he needs to be comfortable in transpositions and octave changes.

	https://youtu.be/QcwhS3VgHpI	QcwhS3VgHpI	All you idiots criticizing his performance. At 66 he was STILL better than anyone performing today.	
			Two Bass players?  If that's what it takes to back up the GFOS. So be it.	
			If James Brown was never born there'd be no such word as funky	
			The majority of the drunk idiots of the audience didn't deserve such a show.	
			Dude had a body guard walk on stage with him!  PIMP!	
			"What an incredible amount of work it must have taken to arrange, choreograph, stage, and rehearse a show like that."

Bon Iver	https://youtu.be/YJNi7aRwUzU	YJNi7aRwUzU	So much credit to whoever mixed the audio. They did an incredible job	
			The drummer looks like Socrates	
			I feel like attending a Bon Iver concert would be a spiritual experience	
			"This DEFINITELY needs to be set as a live album and put on itunes, spotify etc. Incredible performance!!"	
			Imagine Bon Iver and Sigur rós in an album together	
			The dislike button should be disabled for this masterpiece.	
			The dude on drums plays with so much raw emotion	
			This might be the most beautiful version of Creature Fear I've ever heard	
			This is a masterpiece.	
			His songs sound like someone accidentally fell on a piano but hit the perfect note.

			this guy is just RIDICULOUSLY hot	
Taylor Swift	https://youtu.be/_t-fhPUPMrY	_t-fhPUPMrY	The only reason why I wanna be rich is to afford to have Taylor Swift sing Lover live at my wedding reception. Periodttttt	
			I wonder if Taylor’s parents realized they were making history when they bought her her first guitar	
			i love that she always introduces herself like no one knows her	
			"I will never grow tired of Taylor introducing herself like, ""hi, I am Taylor""."	
			She literally could turn any event into her concert	
			"CRUEL SUMMER, MISS AMERICANA & CORNELIA STREET DESERVES MOOOOORE"	
			"She really does know how to interact with the audience & give meaningful, articulate speeches that people wouldn't get bored of.  Truly an icon."

Damien Rice	https://youtu.be/cL7QZv9wCZ8	cL7QZv9wCZ8	Cheers Darlin' is quite possibly the best musical autobiographical performance Ive ever seen.	
			Rice is just genius personified. 	
			Incredible talent	
			"Amazing, what a showman!! he only needs a guitar, a piano and a glass of wine, no need of backup singers nor band."	
			"What a songwriter and performer... even ""authentically drunk"" :p. Thats taking your art seriously!"	
			I wonder what that Cheers Darlin girl would think if she heard it now.	
			Damien Rice is not a Music Artist Damien is the Music KING !!!!

			I hope he gets royalties from Ed sheran	
			one man on a stage with just a guitar. he is such a talent man

			His voice has aged well. Still sounds like he's my age.	
			They sound awesome. Still better then the majority of the crap put out today.	
			One of the seminal connections between rock and electronic dance music. Still sounds relevant and great.	
			When they play Joy Division songs is inpossible to me don't get emotional
